This cornerstone is all about how we view the people sharing ideas, perspectives, and criticisms. Here's how we generally frame things within an SJD context:

1. Who says something is just as (or more) important than what they are saying.
2. We hold the person responsible for (or blame them for) the message they're carrying.

This enables us to hear the same thing from two different people (different because of their stances, identities, etc.) and make two completely different meanings from it (generally explained within the umbrella of "positionality").

It also moves our focus away from situations and systems, and onto the people within them.

<small><strong>Feelings check-in:</strong> If either of the above points feels paradoxical, or these cornerstones in general do, like we're rubbing against other important social justice values, keep feeling that. We'll get to it soon.</small>
