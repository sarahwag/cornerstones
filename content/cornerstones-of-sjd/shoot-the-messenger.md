This cornerstone is all about how we view the people sharing ideas, perspectives, and criticisms. Within an SJD context:

1. When someone says something, we hold _who they are saying it_ to be as important as _what they are saying_ (or more important); and
2. We punish the person for the message they're carrying, the thing they said, or what they believe.

Point 1 enables us to hear the same thing from two different people (different because of their stances, identities, etc.) and make two completely different meanings from it (generally explained within the umbrella of "positionality").

Point 2 moves our focus away from situations and systems -- ignoring the societal forces at work -- and onto the individual person being affected by them, the byproduct of those forces.

<small><strong>Feelings check-in:</strong> If either of the above points feels paradoxical to the goals of social justice, or these cornerstones in general do, like we're rubbing against other important values, keep feeling that. And you're invited to journal about it. We'll get to it soon.</small>
