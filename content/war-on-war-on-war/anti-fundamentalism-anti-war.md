If we're doing the math, and everything we've said so far adds up, the following equation naturally follows:

**Anti-Fundamentalism = Anti-War**

And, of course, the inverse would also be true:

**Supporting War Mentality = Supporting Fundamentalism**

What does this mean for us?

If we stand for one, we stand for the other. We can't be "for war, but only for war against Fundamentalism." The war on the war on the war is just more war.

And if you're telling a story that disrupts one, you'll inevitably disrupt the other.
