Drawing from Eisenstein's essay, you might notice an interesting dynamic: **the mentality of war is both a cause _and_ effect of fundamentalism.** It comes from it, and leads to it.

Remember the [ingredients of fundamentalism](/fundaments-of-fundamentalism/common-ingredients), and how they lead to the "Other" being demonized? That's the beliefs of fundamentalism clarifying what enemy we should be fighting, a war mentality being an _effect_ of fundamentalism.

And war mentality is also a cause of fundamentalism. It requires an enemy for us to oppose:

>"We can also assure ourselves that by adding our blows to the humiliation of the badguy, we ourselves are among the good guys, fighting on the side of right. A badguy thus becomes a necessity to maintain one's self-approval and identity. If there is no bad guy, we must then manufacture one."

When you're thinking in terms of "badguys," and position yourself as the good, fundamental beliefs help us separate who's who. Our dogma starts to look like drawing lines in the sand, _caused_ by a mentality of war.
