With the mentality of war in mind, the SJD Cornerstones start to look like crosshairs, ways we can more clearly target our enemies.

1. **The Seconded Law** helps us aim our sights at _what is_ problematic. Calibrating our targeting system to identify enemy ideas, beliefs, actions, etc.

2. Then **Shoot the Messenger** tells us _who the enemy is_ who should be in our sights (that idiom being more literal than ever), specifically anybody who represents or is connected to what has been named as oppressive.

3. And **Oppressive to the Core** tells us that we need to keep firing until we destroy the entire system. Nothing can remain, collateral damage notwithstanding.
