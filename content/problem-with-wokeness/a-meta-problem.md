One tricky thing that might not have come to your mind, and wasn't directly addressed in the video, is this meta-problem:

**New tenets of SJD, or examples of wokeness-gone-awry, are being created at this moment. So if we see SJD as a problem, merely naming all of the tenets isn't sufficient to solve it. Just like hitting the moles in Whac-a-Mole doesn't make them stop popping up.**

So the solution can't be _just_ naming all the tenets. We need to focus on where the tenets are coming from, how they're connected, and what beliefs are at the core.
