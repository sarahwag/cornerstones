In the first two modules, [Dot-Com-Munity](https://1.course.sjmd.space) and [Barks Like a Dogma](https://2.course.sjmd.space), we laid a lot of groundwork. Now it's time to build something on top of it.

As we move forward, we're going to be encouraging more conversations with your accountabilibuddy, and focusing less on direct replies to us via forms.

Things are also going to get a little riskier, more opinionated, and potentially divisive. So keep our overall goal (charting a path toward equity) and [norms](https://1.course.sjmd.space/redefining-normal/) in mind.
