In the first two modules, [Dot-Com-Munity](https://dotcommunity.course.sjmd.space) and [Barks Like a Dogma](https://barkslikeadogma.course.sjmd.space), we laid a lot of groundwork. Now it's time to build something on top of it.

As we move forward, we're going to rely more on the community and your accountabilibuddy, and less on direct replies via forms.

Things are also going to get a little riskier, more opinionated, and potentially divisive. So keep our overall goal (charting a path toward equity), [guidelines](https://community.sjmd.space/faq), and [norms](https://dotcommunity.course.sjmd.space/redefining-normal/) in mind.
