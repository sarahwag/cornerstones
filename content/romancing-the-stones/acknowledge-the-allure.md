We don't want to pretend that dogma, or fundamentalism, doesn't have appeal. It obviously does, and there are many benefits presented to people who adhere to a creed.

```

**We aren't going to ask you to share your findings**, but definitely keep this conversation in mind as you complete this Module and transition into the next one.
