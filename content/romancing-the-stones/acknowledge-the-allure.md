We don't want to pretend that dogma, or fundamentalism, doesn't have appeal. It obviously does, and there are many benefits presented to people who adhere to a creed.

```
Have a conversation with your accountabilibuddy -- or anyone you can get ahold of (online/remotely is okay, in-person is better) -- about the benefits of fundamentalism. Specifically, talk about each of the cornerstones of SJD, and what they offer the people who uphold them?
```

**We aren't going to ask you to share your findings**, but definitely keep this conversation in mind as you complete this Module and transition into the next one.
