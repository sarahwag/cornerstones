What's great about this idea is that in that conversation, it plays out immediately after Yascha shares it, proving its viability in real time.

If you [keep listening](https://lnns.co/greBjZY274V/4672), you'll hear Sam Harris, the podcast host, weigh in to echo Yascha's point, summing it up as an "unfalsifiable trump card you can play that meets the demand of any occasion."

And then something magical happens. The other podcast guest, Michael Weiss, jumps in, thinking he's adding to Yascha's point, completely oblivious that he's actually proving it.

Weiss says, talking of the fundamentalists who take the "high ground" in Yascha's example:

>"Belonging to a political or social movement gives them a sense of purpose. We see this on Twitter. The campism is so codified and narrowly defined: we have Bernie Bros on the left, MAGA Trump apologists on the right, and then trying to navigate with any sense of independent-mindedness at all makes you a target for everybody."

In that reply, Weiss delivers to us a slurry of simple terms, regurgitated from his position (that lots of people, particularly "online" people share) without much thinking, that unfalsifiably sum up the "bad" people and position himself as morally virtuous, on the high ground.

Yascha replies, politely calling our attention to this:

>"The anti-woke left crowd can fall foul of the same problem, so it's something we all need to check ourselves on as well."

So true! And no shame on Weiss here. We're just pointing out that it's such an easy trap to fall into that Weiss did it _while thinking he's talking about the trap_ -- a trap many of us fall into every day.
