Most of the people adhering to the cornerstones of SJD probably couldn't name them. Fundmentalism isn't obvious to the adherants to fundamentalism: it just makes sense.

Which brings us to this question: what does fundamentalism, or social justice dogma, _give you_? What does it provide?

Listen to Yascha Mounk talk about the benefits of creed and dogma on the _Making Sense_ podcast **starting at the 1:15:43 mark, ending at 1:18:03**:  FYI, the link below goes to a podcast episode called 'The Revenge of History', which only goes for 57:20, so I'm guessing that's the wrong episode
