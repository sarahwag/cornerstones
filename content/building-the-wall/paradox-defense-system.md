One of the other benefits of the wall of SJD is that it protects us from internal contradictions or recognizing incompatible beliefs within our own system. Fundamentalism translates these contradictions into paradoxes, where we unquestioningly accept both conflicting statements as true.

And because we can't question the dogma for fear of being seen as a "them," a lot of the paradoxes go undiscussed -- at least within the social justice movement.

Opponents of social justice (the people who would call "us" a "them") are happy to point out contradictions and hypocrisies within SJD all day long.

```
Pinpoint some paradoxes of SJD -- two seemingly incompatible or contradictory beliefs that are both accepted as true -- that arise from our cornerstones and tenets. If you can't think of any, turn to conversation with your accountabilibuddy (ideal), social media asks of your network, or internet searching (least ideal).
