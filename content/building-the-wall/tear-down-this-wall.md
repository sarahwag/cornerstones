One of the projects of social justice **minus** dogma is going to be tearing down the wall. Expanding our idea of "us."

The distinction between a paradox and a contradiction, within the context of fundamentalism, is one of the walls that creates an "us" and "them." _We_ laugh, or turn up our noses, when _They_ don't see the truth of a paradox. "How simple-minded. How backwards. How unenlightened."

Let's nudge toward dismantling the wall by naming some of the ideas we might be accepting as paradoxes, but likely seem to be contradictions to people outside of SJD, creating room for that truth.

**What paradoxes have you noticed within SJD? Within the cornerstones, the tenets, or the ways that we enact fundamentalism?**
