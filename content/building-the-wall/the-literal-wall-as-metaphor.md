title: "The Literal Wall as Metaphor"

In the United States, the phrase "Build the Wall" is currently (and maybe inexorably) connected to supporters of Trump, and his project to build a wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Infamously, Trump has promised this wall would protect "us" from the worst of "them" -- "their" ["drug dealers, criminals, rapists."](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-37230916/drug-dealers-criminals-rapists-what-trump-thinks-of-mexicans) Without going too Freudian here, Trump's wall is both literal and metaphorical, a physical structure representing protection against a xenophobically-caricatured idea of an enemy.

While social justice people are unanimously opposed to Trump's wall (or at least it seems that way), and take up a lot of anti-wall-in-general stances (e.g., "no borders"), we're hard at work building our own walls.
