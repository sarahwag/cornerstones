You've reached the end of Module 3. So far, we've covered a lot of material.

Sit with all of this -- the makings of real community, spotting tenets of SJD, and cornerstones of fundamentalism -- for as long as you need to starting making mental connections among the ideas.

However, as you start to connect dots, we ask you not to jump to any grand conclusions -- not just yet. This course is set up as one big arc, and we're still on the incline.

In Module 4, we're going to be focusing on the people of SJD, those whom we might have otherwise called "them." And the big picture we're trying to paint will be filled in a little more.
