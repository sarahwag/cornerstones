We want to move away from the whole "Is this person being sincere or calculating?" debate when it comes to virtue signaling. Instead, we want to plot this idea along different axes: _helpful for social justice_ and _helpful for SJD_.

When we see someone virtue signaling, we can ask ourselves:

**Will this expression help us take steps toward equity for all?** The stronger the "yes," here, the more we want to amplify this virtue signaling. It's how we'll find solidarity, clarify our goals, and move forward together.

**Will this expression reinforce social justice dogma, teach others tenets, or increase fundamentalism?** The stronger the "yes," here, the more we want to move away from this, and subtract these forms of virtue signaling from our activism and advocacy.

A lot of the virtue signaling we see in social justice contexts (online, in workshops, at dinner, wherever) is likely both, to different degrees.

The latter is what's most prescient for us here, and it will be important for us to be able to separate signal from noise.
