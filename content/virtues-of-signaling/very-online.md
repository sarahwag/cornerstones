If you're "very online," there's a good chance you know the phrase "virtue signaling." You likely have a lot of gut feelings attached to that phrase. They're likely not positive.

For the rest of you, here's the TL;DR:

> **Virtue signaling** is when you make a public statement that shows you're one of the good ones, angry about the right things.

When people are "accused" of virtue signaling online, which is one of the main/only ways the phrase gets invoked, the implication is that the accused person is being disingenuous, self-serving, or otherwise calculated -- engaging in a performance of types.

The unspoken irony here is that publicly accusing someone of virtue signaling could easily be seen as, well, virtue signaling. We'll leave _this_ paradox unchallenged, and instead **we are going to try to let go of some of the baggage associated with this phrase.**
