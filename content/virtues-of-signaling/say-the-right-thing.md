A lot of SJD shows up in our lives as telling us what the right thing to say is, or by listing out all the wrong things we _shouldn't_ say.

When we say the right thing as a form of virtue signaling, **we are raising our hand to let others know we're one of the good ones**, and simultaneously **teaching others the rules.**

Within social justice education spaces, we often celebrate this as teachable moments, or everyday activism. None of this is inherently bad or dogmatic.

**How do we know if someone is saying the right thing as a byproduct of SJD (or in perpetuating SJD), vs. doing so to help us take steps toward equity?**

Simple: ask them why. "Why should we say **Z**?" or "Why shouldn't we say **X**?"

If their answer is "Because I was told this was right," or, "Because I was told that was bad," we're wading into SJD territory.

And the less grounded their answer is in any plausible path toward equity, involving material, positive change, the more likely we're _not_ increasing the "helpful for social justice" meter, and only helping out the dogma.
