If that was too ambiguous, you'll appreciate dichotomous truth of this one: if someone is willfully misinforming people as a form of virtue signaling, the only benefactor is fundamentalism.

Check out this quote from Nicholas Christakis:

>“The willing embrace of something manifestly false is precisely often how one demonstrates belonging in a group… many religious beliefs have this character, where you’re called upon to believe things which clearly are not true, and that’s a signal that you’re a member of this group, and you have a certain kind of faith."

Virtue signaling by spreading falsehoods is actually a powerful way to demonstrate your membership as an "us", and separate yourself from "them." The riskier the claim the stronger the appeal to fundamentalism.

What better way to signal you're "one of us" than saying something that's factually inaccurate, or believing something absurd, that only "we" believe? Now the rise in ["Flat Earthers"](https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/how-the-internet-made-us-believe-in-a-flat-earth-2e42c3206223) suddenly makes more sense.

**Spreading falsehoods isn't going to advance us toward living social justice for all, but it's certainly helpful for SJD.**
